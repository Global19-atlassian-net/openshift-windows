Windows Nodes in OpenShift

This current is tested on Vmware, with two machines, one running OpenShift 3.11 on RHEL 7.5.
A full openshift subscription is required.

The Windows Node is Windows Server Core 1803.
The Windows node requires it to be enabled for Ansible.
bin/winansible.ps1 set's up the windows node for ansible.

How to Use:

##Repos for Openshift Windows:

Supported
http:/github.com/openshift/openshift-windows
Upstream:
http://github.com/glennswest/openshift-windows

Requirements:
1. Linux node with host name set, and static ip, and a proper search domain
2. Windows node with a hostname set, and dhcp that returns same ip all the time, matching hostname.
3. The windows node must have the correct host name, make sure you rename it.

Overview:
1. Install two nodes, one with RHEL 7.5 and one with Windows 1803.
2. Setup DNS for both nodes, and search domain so the hosts can be found by both there short name, and there fully qualified name.
3. Make sure the windows node can use DHCP to find its IP address.
4. Make sure the Mac address is unique for the windows node in the first 5 bytes.
5. Login to root, and install git
6. git clone repo
7. cd repo (Either hybrid or opepnshift-windows)
8. Run allinone.sh

Important Note: The Windows Node must run on a physical box, or a environment that supports nested virt, with passthru configured on the VM.
